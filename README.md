# Until Dawn (Butterfly Effect Story)

The game features a hyperlink cinema-esque for its multilinear narratives and butterfly effect system in which players must make choices that may change the story.
All playable characters can survive or die, depending on the choices made. 

This is my first big program. It may be not as complex but I love it.
