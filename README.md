# Until-Dawn-Butterfly-Effect-Story-

The game features a hyperlink cinema-esque for its multilinear narratives and butterfly effect system in which players must make choices that may change the story.
All playable characters can survive or die, depending on the choices made. 

This is my first big program. It may be not as complex but I love it.

if you can code where you press a key, it doesnt have to wait and just prints the next line would be nice. (it has a time.sleep so it doesnt smack you with blocks of text)
